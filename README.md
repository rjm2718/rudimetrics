Detection and identification of (overlapping) percussion notes in a noisy environment.
Convolutional NN using Tensorflow is trained on a spectrogram of the input channel.

Labeled training data is generated by mixing live & synthesized drum samples together,
randomly spaced, and amongst various amounts of noise.

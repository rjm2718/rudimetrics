trademark: jump on this quickly, hopefully without having to spend money

patent: research cheapest/quickest option


* auto level trigger
* calibrate filter for particular sounds we're interested in ... 
* obvious challenge: huge dynamic range of signals we want to detect

========================================================================

project #1: [DONE]
 - audio capture with waveform 

project #2:
 - characterizing sticks and pads
 - fir bandpass filter tests
 - develop peak detection techniques

project #3:
 - simple note onset detection for sticks on practice pad
 - tempo, timing jitter, volume jitter display



project #2: simple onset detection by filtering + peak detection

- devise manual, static filters from actual recording (one each for a few different drum/cymbal types)
- simple state estimator for 1/4 note tempo
- simple display for tempo and jitter
